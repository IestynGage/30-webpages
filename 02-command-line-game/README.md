# 02-command-line-game

This is a game based on the browser console.
You can input your command to the console and it playes the next move.

This was fun to make, but you could spend a eternity making a terminal game.

## What did I learn?

* It's possible to style console.log output
* After a while the fact I didn't have any types was frustraing, it would have been a lot easier
