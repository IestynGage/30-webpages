# 30 Pages

This project is a personal journey to create 30 different web pages. 
All in the name of fun and curiosity!
The constraint of the project is to spend roughly an hour on each page.
After the 30 days are done I'll go over each page and aswer any questions I had when developing each page.

## 01-christmas-count-down

Displays how many days until christmas.

Some things I want to research more:
* Whats the difference between `DOMContentLoaded` and `load`.
* How does the snow animation work?

What I found helpful:
* [Blog post on how to add Jest tests for plain HTMl file](https://dev.to/snowleo208/things-i-learned-after-writing-tests-for-js-and-html-page-4lja). I went into this one thinking I would be able to good quality tests, I barely had time to do that!
