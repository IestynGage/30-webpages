# 30 Pages

This project is a personal journey to create 30 different web pages.

The constraint of the project is to spend roughly an hour on each page.

**Webpages:**

* `01-christmas-count-down` - Displays how many days until christmas.
* `02-command-line-game` - A small "terminial" game that runs in the browser console.
* `03-web-ide` - A javascript ide
